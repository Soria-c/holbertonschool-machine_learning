# What is a decision tree? 
* Decision trees belong to the world of supervised machine learning algorithms. We are given a set of individuals, and for each of these individuals, some features are defined.
* One of these features is the target feature : for an individual we want to predict the value of the target feature from the other features, that are consequently considered as explanatory features (often, the target feature is called the dependent feature while the other features are called the independent features). 
* Example : in the following example we have two explanatory features (sex and annual income) and the target is whether or not the individual bought a certain product. Our aim is to predict whether Jim will buy the product.

* And since Jim is a male and has an income larger than 30000, we would predict that Jim doesnâ€™t buy the product.
